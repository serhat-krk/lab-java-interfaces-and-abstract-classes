### Task

In your `README.md`, include an example of when `IntArrayList` would be more efficient and when `IntVector` would be more efficient.


### Answer

`IntArrayList` would be more efficient when we work with smaller size arrays. We will be saving memory space.


`IntVector` would be more efficient when we work with larger size arrays. We will be performing the task faster.
